# Zanobo Rails Base
Rails project base for Zanobo

## Features

### RSpec
Use Rspec for awesome spec testing.

### Styling
Why bootstrap? Most popular, easiest to use, framework agnostic
https://getbootstrap.com/
https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap-sass

### Icons
Bootstrap uses vectors now too, about half as many as FA but also 1/3 the size
I like the look of FA Better but really depends on needs

### JS
Angular because best fills all the app needs in simplest way
